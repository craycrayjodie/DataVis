<h2>Australians will never forget 2020</h2>

At the beginning of the year we had bush fires, followed by the coronavirus pandemic.

By the end of March the Australian borders were shut. Schools closed. We were told to stay at home, and we did. 

Hundreds of offices lay vacant. Classrooms and universities were emptied of students. 

Non-essential businesses closed, arts and leisure events cancelled.

There was a 30 to 40% drop in movements by Australians from March to April. 

Even before the Australian Government closed the borders (on the 20th March) people were moving less. 

(Adams, Adams & Bastiampillai 2020) confirm "populations reduced their movement before and even without stay-at-home orders." Possible reasons for this include, "global media coverage reiterating virus seriousness, broadcasting almost real-time images of full intensive care units and dying families into people's living rooms, in conjunction with minor public health restrictions, sparked fear and drove mass behaviour change."

By the end of March, the Australian Government's border closures, contact tracing and isolation began to slow to spread of the coronavirus. 

In early April Australians began to increase their movements, which also coincides with the start of school holidays. After weeks of lock down we all needed a break and we started to move again.

By the end of June, Queenslanders and Northern Territorians were no longer restricting their movements and actually began to move more in comparison to the baseline period. 
This trend continued until the end of September. 

Queensland and Northern Territory Governments lifted stay at home restrictions from the 1st May and children returned to school early to mid May.

<b>Victorians have experienced the greatest reduction in movement compared to other states. </b>

From early April to June Victorians were moving more compared to the March and April period. 

However, from June to August Victorians began to move less again. This coincides with the second wave of infections that emerged in Victoria during May and June. 

On the 20th June the Victorian Government announced the re-tightening of restrictions on household gatherings, and on the 30th June implemented local lockdowns across 10 different Melbourne postcodes and in regional Victoria. More restrictions were introduced in early July adding two more postcodes to lockdown.

On the 2nd August, Victoria was placed into increased restrictions for a 6 week period. This coincides with Victorians' movements plummeting back to mid April levels (i.e. around -43%), as shown on the graph. 

Gradually since early August, Victorians have been increasingly mobile, which reflects a gradual easing in Victoria's movement restrictions.

On 16 November South Australia reintroduced "significant restrictions" after an outbreak of coronavirus in Adelaide. 

It was short lived, and on the 21st November, South Australia ended its lockdown. These changes are viewable in the graph by the dip in movement to -29%, followed by an increase in movements reflecting the end of the lockdown.
