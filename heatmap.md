<h2>As Busy as a Bee in Maranoa</h2>

It is easy to spot the areas in Australia that experienced severe movement restrictions as well as increased activity based on the depth of colour in the chart. 

Areas that experienced large increases in mobility during the covid pandemic include; Katherine in July, Maranoa over the July to October period, South Australia in June and Esperance in October, as indicated by the deep pink coloured boxes. 

July is one of the peak tourism periods to visit Katherine due to the milder temperatures and less rainfall. 

The award for the 'Most Active People in Australia' goes to the residents of Maranoa in South West Queensland who have been moving well above the baseline period especially during July to September, peaking in October with an increase of 39%.

Maranoa has not been impacted by the social distancing rules that most Victorian residents have experienced. 

The sustained increase in movement for this area is probably related to sheep, beef and grain farming. 

The largest town in Maranoa and the region is Roma, with a population of approximately 6,000. 

Roma has the largest cattle sale yard in Australia and Charleville has one of the few remaining inland abattoirs. 

Most residents in the Maranoa area are involved in the pastoral industry, much of which is run by family businesses. (Fevre n.d.)
